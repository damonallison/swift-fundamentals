# Frameworks

## Static vs. Dynamic Libraries

* [Static and Dynamic Libraries](https://pewpewthespells.com/blog/static_and_dynamic_libraries.html)

### Static Libraries

Static libraries are statically linked into the main executable binary. The
static library code is copied and distributed as part of the main executable.

### Dynamic Libraries

Dynamic libraries are linked to from the main executable and loaded into memory
at runtime.

### Framework

A framework contains a static or dynamic library and potentially other resources
packaged into a bundle.
