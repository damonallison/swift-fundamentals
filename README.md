# Swift Fundamentals #

Code examples that describe the fundamentals of the swift programming language.

## Getting Started ##

Open `swift-fundamentals-workspace.xcworkspace` to get started. This workspace
has two top level elements:

1. Playground. This is simply a scratchpad for you to try new ideas as you're
   reading over the swift-fundamentals source.

2. `swift-fundamentals` - project and target for all the fundamentals source
   code.

`swift-fundamentals` is a Mac command line target. Just run it.
