///
/// A great explanation of Protocols with Associated Types and their wierdness within Swift.
///
/// Alexis Gallagher - Protocols with Associated Types
/// https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWoNjiSPqI8
///
/// 1. How are PATs weird?
///
/// * The are only usable as generic constraints.
///
///   * Every single protocol with an associated type cannot be used in Objective-C.
///   * Everywhere you wanted to use a protocol, you need a generic.
///
///       ` var delegate: Protocol`
///       ` class C<T:Proto> { var delegates:[T] }
///
///   * It excludes dynamic dispatch! Which is probably why you wanted a protocol to begin with.
///     You can have a collection of delegates, but they have to have a generic constraint.
///
///
/// 2. Why are PATs weird?
///
///   * Protocols are "real types" - except when you have an associated type.
///   * Whenever you use a PAT, you have to use a generic type constraint whenver you use the type.
///
/// 3. Is this the plan? Are PATs a long term solution?
///
///    * Yes.
///    * Long term, perhaps we'll get Existentials (from Haskell, other FP languages).
///
/// 4. How to love them?
///
///    * Call them "PATs" rather than "Protocols with Associated Types".
///    * They are not *really* protocols.
///    * Embrace generics (you have to give up dynamic dispatch)
///
