//
// Container is a generic data structure protocol which allows you to add
// and get items, as well as get a count of the items in the container.
//
// Swift is a Protocol-Oriented Language. Rather than using OO inheritance, it is
// better to use protocols. Inheritance hierarcies can get messy.
//
// The way to use generics within protocols is to use associated types. An associated
// type is simple to understand - it is a generic type parameter for a protocol. That's it!
//
// Protocols with Associated Types (PATs) are trickier to understand and use than just using
// a typical protocol. You can't just define a variable of a Protocol with an Associated Type
// like you can with typical protocols. For example:
// This will not compile:
//
// var c: Container
//
// Error: Protocol 'Container' can only be used as a generic constraint because
//        it has Self or associated type requirements
//
// Why?
//
// Because the generic type parameter is not known. You must specify the type parameter
// using a ganeric constraint.

///
/// Associated types are generics for protocols.
///
/// Associated types allow you to specify a placeholder type that will be
/// provided by each protocol implementation. Associated types are only available
/// with protocols.

    var count: Int { get }
    
    /// Allows c[i] ordinal access into the container.
    subscript(i: Int) -> Item { get }
}

/// Subscripts can be generic and include generic type constraints.
///
/// Here, this subscript accepts a sequence of Ints, returning an array of items
/// at the given indices.
