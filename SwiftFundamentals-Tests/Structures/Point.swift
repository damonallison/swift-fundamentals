/// Example structure.
///
/// * Structures should be kept small.
/// * All values in the structure should themselves be structs.
/// * Don't put reference types into a structure - use a class.
///
/// Structures are given a default "memberwise initializer". A memberwise initializer is a compiler-generated initializer that you can use to create a new instance of the struct, fully populated with initial values.
///
/// - important: Memberwise initializers are created with parameters which match the order in which properties are declared. For example, the generated memberwise initializer for `point` is:

///
///         Point p = Point(x: 1, y: 2)
///
///
/// - important: Changing the order of a structures properties will break callers of the memberwise initializers.
///
struct Point : Equatable  {
    
    var x: Int
    var y: Int
    
    /// `mutating` allows you to mutate `var` struct members.
    mutating func offsetBy(x: Int, y: Int) {
        self.x += x
        self.y += y
    }
}

///
/// Conform to the equatable protocol. 
/// 
/// It seems that this function needs to be declared in the global scope (yuk!).
///
func ==(lhs: Point, rhs: Point) -> Bool {
    return lhs.x == rhs.x && lhs.y == rhs.y
}
