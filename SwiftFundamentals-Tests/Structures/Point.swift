/// Example structure.
///
/// * Structures should be kept small.
///
/// * All values in the structure should themselves be value types.
///
/// * Don't put reference types into a structure - use a class.
///   If you add reference types to a `struct` (which is possible)
///   breaks the `copy` value type semantics of structures. 
///
/// * You don't need to inherit properties or behavior
///   from another structure.
///
/// * `struct`s should be relatively small and used only for 
///   small, value type data structures. Classes are the primary 
///   data structure in swift.
///
/// Structures are given a default "memberwise initializer". A memberwise initializer is a compiler-generated initializer that you can use to create a new instance of the struct, fully populated with initial values.
///
/// - important: Memberwise initializers are created with parameters which match the order in which properties are declared. For example, the generated memberwise initializer for `point` is:

///
///         Point p = Point(x: 1, y: 2)
///
///
/// - important: Changing the order of a structures properties will break callers of the memberwise initializers.
///
